very original Idea:

card based city builder / survival builder ((pain))

Singleplayer game, you buy card packs for aditional cards, 4each card pack offers a different set of cards with each a different function, cards in pack are randomized - for gambling addiction... replayability*
Goal is to keep your village alive, because you don't want it to die... right?
Highscore list (for competition and addiction -- monkey see big number, dopamine released)
card limit - yes. (no) //expandible through upgrades/buildings (for pain)

add z to things for swaws and originality.

many classes for GUI
dynamic classes for Stacks and more stacks because stacks in list

Every tile a (dynamic array list) stack
MAKE MOUSE A STACK (for moving more than one card at a time)

tile based (for ocd (and autism))



todo list because fewer files:
- use (maybe) scenebuilder for game menus + panels
- collisons to prevent out of bounds crash
- use json for  easy creation of new cards
- install IJ on laptops for working in the Holidays (the grind is real, fofrath pls give good grade we sacrificed our free time for this)
- create (maybe) new class for card abilities? else yoink them all into card class (more chaos = gud; Khorne approved )
- add offset only after clicking, so the movement is smoother + so faster movement is possible
