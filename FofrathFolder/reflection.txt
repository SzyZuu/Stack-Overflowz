Reflection (bright as the sun, just like this game)
- didn't manage to achieve wanted end result; features like more complex card interactions or moving cards are missing (see idea.txt)
- spent way too much time on small things, like recipes, which we had to change a bit in the end anyway because not all cards should
  get deleted during crafting
- ignored a shit ton of bugs, we managed to get on ark level with bugs
- no graphics (F)
- very hepi that we managed to do basic card interactions at least
- was really fun working continuously on a "bigger" project with more than 1 participant
